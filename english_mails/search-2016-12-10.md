Search backend progress

Hi Min and Darpan.

Sorry for the late update.

Here's my current progress on the backend.

# Summary

- Structures JSON APIs are ready.
- Search response JSON API `MintSearchController.getSearchResult` is still in progress. But can show sample search result
    - Current search result can only parse one level structure dynamically.
    - https://c.na30.visual.force.com/apex/MintSearchDetailSearch
    - Remote Action : `MintSearchController.getSearchResult`
- Search APIs `needs` to rewrite from the scratch in respond to the nested(Multi-level) query for the future use.

# Difficulties and risks

Currently, my design is still not good to fix the problem in a correct way.

The `MintSearchResponse` controller is getting messy with nested logic.

From the above figure.

The each record might show its related object attributes within multi-level.

Let's say if we want to display `LegalEntity` attributes.

We need to fetch the record from `LoanAccount` first,

And then get the `Party`.

From the `Party`, keep fetching the `Account`, `Contact`.

Finally, we can retrieve the `LegalEntity`.

What happens in the backend should go this way.

- Prepare a `query structure parser` to convert the [MintSearchFieldsStructure.json](https://github.com/cloudlending/Collections-Main/blob/mint-theme-search/docs/MintSearchFieldsStructure.json) into corresponding `SOQL` query recursively.

- Build SOQL Query
- Parse SOQL Query Result
- Update Response JSON Object

So far, it's involving lots of back and forth on modifying on the `MintSearchFieldsStructure`.
Due to I could not be able to build a correct SOQL without considering thoroughly.
